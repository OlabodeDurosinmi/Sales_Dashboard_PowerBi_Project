# Sales Project
# Project Objective:

The objective of this project is to deliver a comprehensive analysis and dynamic dashboard for customer behavior, market trends, and financial performance. By leveraging customer and transactional data, the analysis will uncover insights into sales distribution across customer segments, retention rates by sales type, repeat purchase behavior, and regional product popularity. Financial metrics such as total revenue, cost, profit margins, and the impact of discounts will be assessed to evaluate overall profitability. Advanced analytics will explore sales growth trends, product contributions to revenue, discount-sales correlations, and the performance of top-selling products. The project also aims to compare actual versus target sales (if available) and identify the most lucrative payment modes. A dynamic dashboard will be designed to visualize KPIs like total sales, profit, discounts, and units sold, featuring interactive charts and filters for deep, user-driven insights.
